        <h1>Aidan's Best Anime List</h1>

        <h2>My Top 3 Animes of All Time</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>One Piece</h3>
        <p>
            By far the best world building, the plots interesting and very detailed.
            Great music and has many great life lessons. Covers real world problems.
        </p>

        <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
        <p>
            Good world building, best plot I've seen and is extrememly detailed
            Great music, animation, and has great life lessons. Makes you question reality
        </p>

        <h3>Death Note</h3>
        <p>
            Very interesting and the most detailed plot I've seen.
            Probably the best show to introduce someone into anime.
